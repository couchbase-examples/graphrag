    "# Tutorial on GraphRAG with Couchbase\n",
    "This notebook walks through the process of setting up a search engine that combines Couchbase for storing embeddings, OpenAI's models for generating embeddings, and a local search engine for querying structured data. This is useful when you need to search through structured data using natural language queries, leveraging both machine learning and a database."

    "- OPENAI_API_KEY: This is your personal API key for accessing OpenAI's services. It's required for authentication when making requests to OpenAI's API, allowing you to use their language models and other AI services.\n",
    "- LLM_MODEL: This variable specifies which Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI to use for text generation tasks. For example, it could be set to \"gpt-4\" for using GPT-4, or \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" for using ChatGPT.\n",
    "- EMBEDDING_MODEL: This defines the specific model used for generating text embeddings. Text embeddings are vector representations of text that capture semantic meaning. For OpenAI, a common choice is \"text-embedding-ada-002\".\n",

      "TextUnit(id='5b2d21ec6fc171c30bdda343f128f5a6', short_id='0', text='# Operation: Dulce\\n\\n## Chapter 1\\n\\nThe thrumming of monitors cast a stark contrast to the rigid silence enveloping the group. Agent Alex Mercer, unfailingly determined on paper, seemed dwarfed by the enormity of the sterile briefing room where Paranormal Military Squad\\'s elite convened. With dulled eyes, he scanned the projectors outlining their impending odyssey into Operation: Dulce.\\n\\n“I assume, Agent Mercer, you’re not having second thoughts?” It was Taylor Cruz’s voice, laced with an edge that demanded attention.\\n\\nAlex flickered a strained smile, still thumbing his folder\\'s corner. \"Of course not, Agent Cruz. Just trying to soak in all the details.\" The compliance in his tone was unsettling, even to himself.\\n\\nJordan Hayes, perched on the opposite side of the table, narrowed their eyes but offered a supportive nod. \"Details are imperative. We’ll need your clear-headedness down there, Mercer.\"\\n\\nA comfortable silence, the kind that threaded between veterans of shared secrets, lingered briefly before Sam Rivera, never one to submit to quiet, added, \"I’ve combed through the last transmission logs. If anyone can make sense of the anomalies, it’s going to be the two of you.\"\\n\\nTaylor snorted dismissively. “Focus, people. We have protocols for a reason. Speculation is counter-productive.” The words \\'counter-productive\\' seemed to hang in the air, a tacit reprimand directed at Alex.\\n\\nFeeling the weight of his compliance conflicting with his natural inclination to leave no stone unturned, Alex straightened in his seat. \"I agree, Agent Cruz. Protocol is paramount,\" he said, meeting Taylor\\'s steely gaze. It was an affirmation, but beneath it lay layers of unspoken complexities that would undoubtedly unwind with time.\\n\\nAlex\\'s submission, though seemingly complete, didn\\'t escape Jordan, who tilted their head ever so slightly, their eyes revealing a spark of understanding. They knew well enough the struggle of aligning personal convictions with overarching missions. As everyone began to collect their binders and prepare for departure, a quiet resolve took form within Alex, galvanized by the groundwork laid by their interactions. He may have spoken in compliance, but his determination had merely taken a subtler form — one that wouldn\\'t surrender so easily to the forthcoming shadows.\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nDr. Jordan Hayes shuffled a stack of papers, their eyes revealing a tinge of skepticism at Taylor Cruz\\'s authoritarian performance. _Protocols_, Jordan thought, _are just the framework, the true challenges we\\'re about to face lie well beyond the boundaries of any protocol._ They cleared their throat before speaking, tone cautious yet firm, \"Let\\'s remember, the unknown variables exceed the known. We should remain adaptive.\"\\n\\nA murmur of agreement echoed from Sam Rivera, who leaned forward, lacing their fingers together as if weaving a digital framework in the air before them, \"Exactly, adaptability could be the key to interpreting the signal distortions and system malfunctions. We shouldn\\'t discount the… erratic.\"\\n\\nTheir words hung like an electric charge in the room, challenging Taylor\\'s position with an inherent truth. Cruz’s jaw tightened almost imperceptibly, but the agent masked it with a small nod, conceding to the omnipresent threat of the unpredictable. \\n\\nAlex glanced at Jordan, who never looked back, their gaze fixed instead on a distant point, as if envisioning the immense dark corridors they were soon to navigate in Dulce. Jordan was not one to embrace fantastical theories, but the air of cautious calculation betrayed a mind bracing for confrontation with the inexplicable, an internal battle between the evidence of their research and the calculating skepticism that kept them alive in their field.\\n\\nThe meeting adjourned with no further comments, the team members quietly retreading the paths to their personal preparations. Alex, trailing slightly behind, observed the others. _The cautious reserve Jordan wears like armor doesn\\'t fool me_, he thought, _their analytical mind sees the patterns I do. And that\\'s worth more than protocol. That\\'s the connection we need to survive this._\\n\\nAs the agents dispersed into the labyrinth of the facility, lost in their thoughts and preparations, the base\\'s halogen lights flickered, a brief and unnoticed harbingers of the darkness to come.\\n\\n\\\\*\\n\\nA deserted corridor inside the facility stretched before Taylor Cruz, each footstep rhythmic and precise. Cruz, ambitious and meticulous, eyed the troops passing by with a sardonic tilt of the lips. Obedience—it was as much a tool as any weapon in the arsenal, and Cruz wielded it masterfully. To them, it was another step toward unfettered power within the dark bowels of the military complex.\\n\\nInside a secluded equipment bay, Cruz began checking over gear with mechanical efficiency. They traced fingers over the sleek surface of an encrypted radio transmitter. \"If protocols are maintained,\" said Cruz aloud, rehearsing the speech for their subordinates, \"not only will we re-establish a line of communication with Dulce, but we shall also illuminate the darkest secrets it conceals.\"\\n\\nAgent Hayes appeared in the doorway, arms crossed and a knowing glint in their eyes. \"You do understand,\" Jordan began, the words measured and probing, \"that once we\\'re in the depths, rank gives way to survival instincts. It\\'s not about commands—it\\'s empowerment through trust.\"\\n\\nThe sentiment snagged on Cruz\\'s armor of confidence, probing at the insecurities festering beneath. Taylor offered a brief nod, perhaps too curt, but enough to acknowledge Jordan\\'s point without yielding ground. \"Trust,\" Cruz mused, \"or the illusion thereof, is just as potent.\"\\n\\nSilence claimed the space between them, steeped in the reality of the unknown dangers lurking in the shadows of the mission. Cruz diligently returned to the equipment, the act a clear dismissal.\\n\\nNot much later, Cruz stood alone', text_embedding=None, entity_ids=['b45241d70f0e43fca764df95b2b81f77', '4119fd06010c494caa07f439b333f4c5', 'd3835bf3dda84ead99deadbeac5d0d7d', '077d2820ae1845bcbb1803379a3d1eae', '3671ea0dd4e84c1a9b02c5ab2c8f4bac', '19a7f254a5d64566ab5cc15472df02de', 'e7ffaee9d31d4d3c96e04f911d0a8f9e'], relationship_ids=['bb9e01bc171d4326a29afda59ece8d17', '3c063eea52e94164b70c99431ea30bae', '252cc8452bfc4c2aa58cab68d8b61879', '7e2c84548fb94ee395ba8588d8f2a006', '3e95dacfe57b4d57b5da4310ef2e157f', '1f1545308e9347af91fd03b94aadc21f', '6ea81acaf232485e94fff638e03336e1', '86505bca739d4bccaaa1a8e0f3baffdc', '1af9faf341e14a5bbf4ddc9080e8dc0b', '6090e736374d45fd84f0e4610a314f8f', '735d19aea0744b2295556841c5c4c3fd', '6e0c81bef5364c988b21bf9b709d9861'], covariate_ids=None, n_tokens=1200, document_ids=['958fdd043f17ade63cb13570b59df295'], attributes=None)\n",

    "### **7. Building the Search Engine (In the Context of Graphrag)**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we focus on creating a search engine that integrates multiple components, specifically designed for the **Graphrag** system. Graphrag is a sophisticated architecture built for handling structured data, entities, relationships, and other contextual information to provide semantic search capabilities. This search engine allows you to query this structured data using **natural language** and get relevant, context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we explain the components of the search engine in detail and how they contribute to its functionality within Graphrag.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Context Builder (LocalSearchMixedContext)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LocalSearchMixedContext` class is the cornerstone of our search engine in Graphrag. It acts as a **contextual environment** for the search process by combining various types of data—such as **community reports, text units, entities, relationships, and covariates**—into a coherent structure that can be used by the search engine. In this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Community Reports**: These are structured documents or insights generated at a community level, such as summaries or analytics reports, which are crucial when trying to query community-specific data.\n",
    "- **Text Units**: Smaller pieces of text, such as paragraphs, sentences, or tokens that are stored in the system. These units help in understanding specific parts of the context when answering questions.\n",
    "- **Entities**: These represent the core subjects (people, organizations, products, etc.) around which your queries are structured. Each entity has certain attributes and semantic embeddings stored in Couchbase, and these are used to enrich the search results.\n",
    "- **Relationships**: The connections between entities, which can represent anything from business partnerships to familial ties or data dependencies. Understanding these relationships helps in contextualizing the search results more effectively.\n",
    "- **Covariates**: Additional variables or metadata that provide more information about entities and relationships. These could include factors like location, time, or other metrics that affect the relevance of the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these elements work together to build the **context** that the search engine will use to find and rank results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **entity_text_embeddings**: The entity descriptions are stored as vector embeddings (using the Couchbase vector store) to help in finding semantically similar entities.\n",
    "- **text_embedder**: This is the **OpenAI embedding model** used to embed both the entities and user queries in a similar vector space, allowing for meaningful similarity comparisons.\n",
    "- **token_encoder**: Tokenization splits the input text into tokens (smaller chunks), making it easier to process by the language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Local Search Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the context is established, we define the parameters for the **search engine**. These parameters guide how the search engine processes the context to answer a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **text_unit_prop**: This sets the proportion of text units to be considered when building the context. In this case, 50% of the context comes from text units.\n",
    "- **community_prop**: Similar to `text_unit_prop`, this defines how much weight to give community reports. Here, 10% of the context is derived from community reports.\n",
    "- **conversation_history_max_turns**: This specifies how many conversation history turns are retained when building the context. It helps in multi-turn queries, where the context from previous queries may still be relevant.\n",
    "- **top_k_mapped_entities**: Defines how many of the most relevant entities should be considered in each query. In this case, we are considering the top 10 entities.\n",
    "- **top_k_relationships**: Similarly, we consider the top 10 relationships that are most relevant to the query.\n",
    "- **include_entity_rank**: Whether to rank entities based on their relevance to the query.\n",
    "- **include_relationship_weight**: Whether to include relationship weights in the ranking process. This is crucial because certain relationships may have higher importance based on the data being queried.\n",
    "- **embedding_vectorstore_key**: Defines the **key** for accessing entity embeddings from Couchbase. Here, we use `EntityVectorStoreKey.ID` as the identifier for retrieving the correct embeddings.\n",
    "- **max_tokens**: The maximum number of tokens to consider in the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Language Model Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "For answering the query, we use the **language model** (LLM) to generate the response. The parameters for the LLM are configured here:\n",
    "- **max_tokens**: Limits the number of tokens (words or sub-words) in the generated answer.\n",
    "- **temperature**: Controls the randomness of the output. Setting it to `0.0` makes the model’s answers more deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Integrating Everything: Creating the Search Engine**\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, all components are integrated into the `LocalSearch` class, which serves as the main search engine. This class is responsible for:\n",
    "- **Accepting queries** in natural language.\n",
    "- **Using the context builder** to form a detailed context based on the available structured data (entities, relationships, text, reports).\n",
    "- **Passing the query and context** to the language model (LLM), which generates the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search engine is now ready to process queries, using the underlying Graphrag system to provide context-aware and semantically rich answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we have built a search engine specifically designed for the **Graphrag** system. This search engine leverages **structured data** (entities, relationships, reports, etc.) and integrates **semantic embeddings** stored in Couchbase. The search engine processes the query using OpenAI's language model, which uses the structured data context to generate meaningful answers.\n",
